# PI1541pcb

This is a PCB based on the Steve White schematic. You just plug on the top of a RPI 3 and you have a fully working 1541 disk emulator :). You can access to the original article from here https://cbm-pi1541.firebaseapp.com/.

# Note
This is a work in progress, several testing must be made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
